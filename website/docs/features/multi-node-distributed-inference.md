# Multi-Node Distributed Inference

The Headlamp-KAITO plugin provides powerful multi-node distributed inference capabilities, enabling you to deploy large AI models across multiple GPU nodes for improved performance, scalability, and resource utilization.

## Overview

Multi-node distributed inference allows you to:
- **Scale horizontally** by distributing model workloads across multiple GPU nodes
- **Handle larger models** that don't fit on a single node
- **Increase availability** with redundancy across nodes

## Deployment Strategies

### 1. Explicit Node Selection

Select specific nodes for precise control over your deployment:

```yaml
resource:
  count: 3
  preferredNodes:
    - gpu-node-1
    - gpu-node-2  
    - gpu-node-3
  instanceType: Standard_NC80adis_H100_v5
  labelSelector:
    matchLabels:
      node.kubernetes.io/instance-type: Standard_NC80adis_H100_v5
```

**Use cases:**
- High-performance workloads requiring specific hardware
- Testing on known node configurations

### 2. Count-Based Auto-Provisioning

Specify the number of nodes while letting KAITO handle the selection:

```yaml
resource:
  count: 4
  instanceType: Standard_NC80adis_H100_v5
  labelSelector:
    matchLabels:
      apps: llama-3-8b
```

**Use cases:**
- Predictable scaling requirements
- Cost optimization with specific node counts
- Load balancing across available resources

### 3. Full Auto-Provisioning

Let KAITO determine the optimal configuration:

```yaml
resource:
  instanceType: Standard_NC80adis_H100_v5
  labelSelector:
    matchLabels:
      apps: llama-3-8b
```

**Use cases:**
- Development and testing environments
- Dynamic workloads with varying requirements
- Simplified deployment workflows

## Node Selection Interface

The plugin provides an intuitive interface for managing multi-node deployments:

### Node Selection Features

- **GPU Node Filtering**: Automatically shows only GPU-enabled nodes
- **Instance Type Detection**: Dynamically extracts instance types from selected nodes
- **Node Status Indicators**: Real-time health and availability status
- **Taint Awareness**: Displays node scheduling restrictions
- **Label-Based Filtering**: Advanced filtering using Kubernetes labels

### Quick Selectors

Pre-configured options for common scenarios:
- Standard NC24 Instances
- Standard NC96 Instances
- GPU + AMD64 architecture
- Custom label combinations

## Benefits of Multi-Node Inference

### Performance Improvements

- **Parallel Processing**: Distribute inference requests across multiple nodes
- **Reduced Latency**: Process multiple requests simultaneously
- **Higher Throughput**: Aggregate processing power of multiple GPUs

### Scalability Advantages

- **Horizontal Scaling**: Add more nodes to handle increased load
- **Model Sharding**: Split large models across multiple nodes
- **Dynamic Scaling**: Adjust node count based on demand

### Cost Optimization

- **Instance Type Flexibility**: Use smaller, more cost-effective instances
- **Spot Instance Support**: Leverage spot pricing across multiple nodes
- **Resource Efficiency**: Better GPU utilization across the cluster

### High Availability

- **Fault Tolerance**: Continue operation if individual nodes fail
- **Load Distribution**: Prevent single points of failure
- **Graceful Degradation**: Maintain service with reduced capacity

## Integration with KAITO

The multi-node features integrate seamlessly with KAITO's capabilities:

- **Automatic Model Sharding**: KAITO handles model distribution
- **Service Discovery**: Unified endpoints for distributed clusters
- **Health Monitoring**: Built-in monitoring and alerting
- **Dynamic Scaling**: Runtime adjustment of node configurations

## Getting Started

1. **Access the Deployment Dialog**: Select a model from the catalog
2. **Configure Node Selection**: Choose your preferred deployment strategy
3. **Review Configuration**: Verify the generated YAML configuration
4. **Deploy**: Apply the configuration to your cluster
5. **Monitor**: Track deployment status and performance metrics

The multi-node distributed inference feature makes it easy to deploy and manage large-scale AI workloads while maintaining the simplicity and user-friendliness that KAITO is known for.
