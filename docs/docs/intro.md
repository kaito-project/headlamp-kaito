# Introduction to Headlamp KAITO

**Latest Release:** July 14th, 2025. Headlamp-KAITO v0.0.3.

**First Release:** June 25th, 2025. Headlamp-KAITO v0.0.1.

## Purpose

Headlamp-KAITO enhances the [KAITO VSCode Extension](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/aks-extension-kaito) with a modern, intuitive UI built directly into Headlamp. Instead of relying on YAML or CLI workflows, this version introduces a visual experience that simplifies GPU node provisioning and model deployment for AKS users.
This plugin serves as a bridge between Headlamp's Kubernetes management capabilities and KAITO's AI workload orchestration. It transforms complex CLI and YAML-based AI model deployment workflows into an intuitive web interface that handles GPU node provisioning, model deployment, and interactive AI chat sessions.

## Integration Points

The plugin connects to several external systems to provide its functionality:

â€¢ **Headlamp Plugin API:** Provides UI framework and Kubernetes API access
â€¢ **KAITO Controller:** Manages AI workload deployments and GPU provisioning
â€¢ **Kubernetes API:** Accesses Workspace CRDs and pod management
â€¢ **GitHub Repository:** Retrieves supported model definitions
â€¢ **AI Model Endpoints:** Facilitates chat interactions through port forwarding

## Key Features

KAITO has the following key differentiations compared to most of the mainstream
model deployment methodologies built on top of virtual machine infrastructures:

â€¢ **Enhanced UI:** Interact with KAITO directly in Headlamp through a modern, intuitive interface, eliminating manual CLI steps.
â€¢ **One-click Model Deployment:** Deploy validated models from the KAITO Model Catalog with a single click.
â€¢ **Automatic GPU Provisioning:** KAITOâ€™s controller logic provisions GPU-backed nodes automatically based on model requirements.
â€¢ **Dynamic Model Discovery:** Discover available models dynamically from within the current namespace.
â€¢ **Integrated Port Forwarding:** Built-in port forwarding with real-time connection status and error handling.
â€¢ **AI-powered Chat Assistant:** Get guided troubleshooting and user support through an integrated AI chat assistant.

## KAITO Architecture

KAITO follows the classic Kubernetes Custom Resource Definition(CRD)/controller design pattern. Users manage a `workspace` custom resource which describes the GPU requirements and the inference or tuning specification. KAITO controllers automate the deployment by reconciling the `workspace` custom resource.

The major components consist of:

â€¢ **Workspace controller:** Reconciles the `workspace` custom resource, creates `machine` custom resources to trigger node auto provisioning, and creates the inference or tuning workload (`deployment`, `statefulset` or `job`) based on the model preset configurations.

â€¢ **Node provisioner controller:** The controller's name is gpu-provisioner in [gpu-provisioner helm chart](https://github.com/Azure/gpu-provisioner/tree/main/charts/gpu-provisioner). It uses the `machine` CRD originated from [Karpenter](https://sigs.k8s.io/karpenter) to interact with the workspace controller. It integrates with Azure Resource Manager REST APIs to add new GPU nodes to the AKS or AKS Arc cluster.

:::note
The [gpu-provisioner](https://github.com/Azure/gpu-provisioner) is an open sourced component. It can be replaced by other controllers if they support [Karpenter-core](https://sigs.k8s.io/karpenter) APIs.

The command also installs all necessary dependencies you need to run Docusaurus.

## Start your site

Run the development server:

```bash
cd my-website
npm run start
```

The `cd` command changes the directory you're working with. In order to work with your newly created Docusaurus site, you'll need to navigate the terminal there.

The `npm run start` command builds your website locally and serves it through a development server, ready for you to view at http://localhost:3000/.

Open `docs/intro.md` (this page) and edit some lines: the site **reloads automatically** and displays your changes.
